# HyprGrid Configuration File (Example)
# Copy this file to: ~/.config/hypr/hg_config.conf
#
# This file defines the grid overlay dimensions for the HyprGrid
# keyboard-driven mouse controller.
#
# NOTE: Monitors are auto-detected from Hyprland at runtime.
# You do NOT need to configure monitors manually.

# Grid dimensions (for landscape orientation)
# - These values will be used as-is for landscape monitors (width > height)
# - For portrait monitors (width < height), rows and cols will be swapped automatically
grid_rows = 10
grid_cols = 20

# Recommended values:
# - grid_rows: 5-20 (reasonable range: 2-50)
# - grid_cols: 10-30 (reasonable range: 2-50)

# Border settings (optional - defaults shown below)
# Whether to draw borders between grid cells
border_enabled = true

# Color of the grid cell borders (hex format: #RRGGBB or #RGB)
border_color = "#FFFFFF"

# Width of the grid cell borders in pixels (0-10)
border_width = 1

# The grid will appear only on the currently focused monitor.
# Monitor information is detected automatically via 'hyprctl monitors -j'.
