# HyprGrid - Hyprland Configuration Example
#
# Add these lines to your ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf to enable HyprGrid

# ============================================================================
# Keybind to summon HyprGrid
# ============================================================================
# This assumes the compiled binary is named 'hyprgrid' and is in ~/.config/hypr/
# Keybind: SUPER + CTRL + G
bind = $mainMod CTRL, G, exec, ~/.config/hypr/hyprgrid

# Alternative keybind examples:
# bind = $mainMod, S, exec, ~/.config/hypr/hyprgrid              # SUPER + S
# bind = $mainMod SHIFT, G, exec, ~/.config/hypr/hyprgrid        # SUPER + SHIFT + G
# bind = ALT, G, exec, ~/.config/hypr/hyprgrid                   # ALT + G

# ============================================================================
# Window Rules to make HyprGrid a proper overlay
# ============================================================================
# These rules target the window by its initialTitle "HyprGrid"
# They ensure the grid appears as a fullscreen, transparent overlay

# Make the window float (not tiled)
windowrulev2 = float, initialTitle:^(HyprGrid)$

# Set the window to fullscreen mode
windowrulev2 = fullscreen, initialTitle:^(HyprGrid)$

# Remove window borders
windowrulev2 = noborder, initialTitle:^(HyprGrid)$

# Remove drop shadows
windowrulev2 = noshadow, initialTitle:^(HyprGrid)$

# Disable blur effects (important for performance)
# Without this, Hyprland will attempt to blur the entire fullscreen overlay
# which is wasteful and can cause performance issues
windowrulev2 = noblur, initialTitle:^(HyprGrid)$

# Set window opacity (0.0 = fully transparent, 1.0 = fully opaque)
# 0.8 provides good visibility while allowing the desktop to show through
windowrulev2 = opacity 0.8, initialTitle:^(HyprGrid)$

# ============================================================================
# Optional: Additional window rules you might want to consider
# ============================================================================

# Pin to all workspaces (if you want the grid to appear regardless of workspace)
# windowrulev2 = pin, initialTitle:^(HyprGrid)$

# Disable animations for instant appearance/disappearance
# windowrulev2 = noanim, initialTitle:^(HyprGrid)$

# Focus the window immediately when it appears
# windowrulev2 = stayfocused, initialTitle:^(HyprGrid)$

# ============================================================================
# Notes
# ============================================================================
#
# After adding these configurations:
# 1. Save your hyprland.conf file
# 2. Reload Hyprland config: hyprctl reload
#    OR restart Hyprland
#
# To test if the binary path is correct:
#   ~/.config/hypr/hyprgrid
#
# The Grid awaits. End of line.
